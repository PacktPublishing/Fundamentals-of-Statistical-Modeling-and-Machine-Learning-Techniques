# Fundamentals of Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning Techniques [Video]
This is the code repository for [Fundamentals of Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning Techniques [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/fundamentals-statistical-modeling-and-machine-learning-techniques?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788833981), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Complex statistics in Machine Learning worry a lot of developers. Knowing statistics helps you build strong Machine Learning models that are optimized for a given problem statement. This video will teach you all it takes to perform complex statistical computations required for Machine Learning. Understand the real-world examples that discuss the statistical side of Machine Learning and familiarize yourself with it. We will discuss the application of frequently used algorithms on various domain problems, using both Python and R programming. We will use libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, random Forest and so on. By the end of the course, you will have mastered the required statistics for Machine Learning and will be able to apply your new skills to any sort of industry problem.
